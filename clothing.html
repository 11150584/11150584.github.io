		<p>You may find yoga very difficult if you don’t know the proper moves. In the past, you had to join a yoga class to learn how to perfect those moves, but now there are smart clothes that can teach you just that. Nadi X, developed by Sydney-based startup Wearable X, will help you achieve flawless yoga moves. The smart pants come with built-in haptic vibrations that gently pulse at the hips, knees and ankles to encourage you to move and/or hold positions. Nadi X pants sync up via Bluetooth to your phone and, through the companion app, gives you additional feedback. They come in four sizes – XS, S, M, L – and four styles – Midnight, Midnight with black, Black/White with mesh and Navy/Gray with mesh. Price: $179.</p>
